        referred to as the &ldquo;Products&rdquo;) provided by Disclave under any ongoing agreement.
        It’s designed to protect us, our customers, and the general Internet community from
        unethical, irresponsible, and illegal activity.

      <Paragraph>
        We are opposed to all forms of abuse, discrimination, rights infringement, and/or any action

        where applicable, their users (&ldquo;end-users&rdquo;) to likewise engage our Products with
        similar intent.

        violates our acceptable use policy, we reserve the right to terminate any Products
        associated with the offending account or the account itself or take any remedial or
        preventative action we deem appropriate, without notice. To the extent permitted by law, no

        acceptable use policy.
