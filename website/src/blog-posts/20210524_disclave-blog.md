We are constantly working on new features to make Disclave a better and more valuable platform. Each week, we try to add something new, improve the user experience, or fix some flaws. We like to tell our users about all the exciting changes but using popular social media platforms may not be enough. That is why we decided to create a simple blog, where we may share all the new features directly from the Disclave website.


On this blog, we will write posts about new features and changes to the platform. We will provide practical tips about using Disclave, what is possible, and what features may be the most useful for you. We will also try to share our plans, what direction we are going with the platform and what new you could expect soon.


Of course, build the platform is more important for use than writing blog posts. If there is nothing new on the blog for a while, it may be because we are working on something fresh and exciting, which takes a lot of our time. We will post about it when it is ready, so wait patiently, use our platform, and leave a comment to let us know what you like and what you would like to change on Disclave.
