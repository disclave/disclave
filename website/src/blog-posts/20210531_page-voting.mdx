Have you ever visited a new website and wondered if it is worth spending some time to read the content of this page? With Disclave, you can check what others think about this website, quickly verify the overall rating and decide if it is worth your time.

## Comment and vote

Until now, the only way how you could share on Disclave what do you think about the particular website was to leave a comment. And if you wanted to learn the overall opinion from others, you had to read all the comments. It is not a problem now because we don't have many comments on our platform, but we hope it may change soon, so we want to be ready for every situation.

That is why we decided to introduce a new feature. Now, you can vote on each page to quickly share your opinion. Click "+" if you like it or "-" if you don't like it. If you are not sure, you don't have to vote. Read the comments, browse the website, and return later to leave your vote for future users.

Of course, the simple vote may not be enough to share all thought, so we still encourage you to take a moment and leave a comment. Please write what you like or dislike to help other users compare it with their thoughts.

## Browse top-rated pages

Using the votes from our users, we are building the <Link href="/pages/top-rated">top-rated ranking</Link>. It is constantly and automatically updated after each vote from a user. If your favorite page is missing, don't wait - vote for it and leave a comment to encourage other users to do the same.

## Use browser extension

Leaving a website to check the votes or add your opinion may be too much for some of you. That is why our <Link href="/extensions">browser extension</Link> supports commenting and voting. You can use most of the Disclave functionalities without stopping browsing.

## Share on your website

If you want to ask users their opinion about your website, you don't have to implement a custom solution or add links to external websites like Disclave. <Link href="/plugins">Install our plugin on your website</Link> and allow users to comment, vote, and view others' opinions instantly, directly from your page.
