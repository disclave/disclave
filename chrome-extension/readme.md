# Web Chat Chrome extension

## Getting started

To build the extension, and rebuild it when the files are changed, run

```
$ npm start
```

After the project has been built, a directory named `dist` has been created. You have to add this directory to your Chrome browser:

1. Open Chrome.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable _Developer mode_.
4. Click _Load unpacked_.
5. Select the `dist` directory.
